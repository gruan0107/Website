                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Iâ€™m Guoyi Ruan, born and raised in Beijing China , where is mishmash of traditional versus modern, cultural diversity is highly valued and respected. These diversities have a huge influence on me since childhood, I learned to look at the world in different ways. I had a wonderful childhood, grandma is a prominent interior architect, I used to see her sketching and followed her to see many projects. Because my parents showed their full support in my enthusiasm of drawing, I began to develop my sketches and models before my primary school. Over years practicing and learning, I become more skillful in drawing my ideas on paper and computer, meanwhile I believe this is a powerful ability for future communication and picture my ideas.

                    <p>Currently, I'm a grad student in SFSU, my major is computer science. My interest is user interaction design, largely from a desire to put art and computer science together in a more harmonious fashion. The fast growing demands of high technology. Design has become increasingly important to computer scientists and at the same time computation has become important to designers. As computing has matured as a discipline, it has expanded its focus to include the physical and virtual settings in which users interact with the machine.  Specialties like human computer interaction, ubiquitous computing, gaming and visualization require an understanding not only of the logic of the machine, but also the logic of the user.  Based on these concerns, the design thinking ability that is an integral part of design training is of interest as an alternative paradigm that may change the way that students think and operate. That encourages me to continue my graduate study major in the CS
